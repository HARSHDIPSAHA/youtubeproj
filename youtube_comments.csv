comment is It's so cool that even after 1070 chapters we still have loads to learn about some of the most interesting characters in the series with likes 677 with user_id @Patterrz and published  1 year ago
comment is I think Dragon and the army fled the scene when BB came because he is not their objective at this point in time. Fighting a full Yonko crew would have ended with too many casualties. And they need every person in their army for the day the war with the WG begins. It was a tactical retreat wich was the smartest move for them! with likes 339 with user_id @Ramonnnn and published  1 year ago
comment is I dont think nika possessed the nika fruit instead i think the nika fruit was born from peoples desire to have him back after his passing or to be him since he was such an influential figure with likes 113 with user_id @10da4 and published  1 year ago

"comment is well the ""killing observation haki"" - thing of shanks makes absolutly sense for me - we know you need to stay focused to use observation haki, but the pure presnce of Shanks let admirals shiver, let objectives break, you have marco saying: you have to stay focused just stay in his presence - how would you use observation haki when your whole body trembles of fear, or even if you are a yonko you still tremble out of excitement to fight such a worthy opponent with likes 160 with user_id @alexthielke and published  1 year ago"

As for what type of DF, we don't really know, it could be Mythical Zoan, Paramecia, or Logia.

"comment is  @obmis_arraid21  you are 100% right. but let's not forget the fact that oda could just gas light us into believing that teach body is the reson he can eat two (or more devil fruits). Marco must know the fact that teach can't sleep which  means he might had asumed that his body is special in many ways and make the point that he ate two devil fruit's cause of that . and let's not forget that nor the bb or any other titanic captain said that he ate 2 devil fruit's neither that he can and in the resent chapter teach said use the devil fruit not eat  it which i think proves my theory

"comment is  @hugosz283  predicting the future has many weaknesses for it to work
First, Shanks would've seen the future on Fuusha village, not followed Luffy's future
Second, even Capone bege can change the future. The second someone reacts to your actions after using future sight it's already changed
Third, though katakuri seems able to predict the environment and random attacks such as snakeman, he still showed you can't predict things you can't sense. Case and point, he's unable to listen to Pudding and Sanji in the future, so he could only go by the knowledge of pudding crying and not what they said

It's downright impossible with likes 5 with user_id @Satepin and published  1 year ago"
"comment is That would make him undefeatable unless there was a way to counter that. Or if it wasn't observation suited for battle like that because seeing basically everything years into the future would give him the ability to decide to engage or not based on results of him winning or losing etc its way too broken. It's more likely that Shanks just saw it in Luffy and that he has such strong conquerors haki it blocks use of observation makes it hard to fight him etc

In my opinion Mihawk will have better observation since Oda at first thought of calling him clairvoyant his nickname is Hawkeye and I doubt Shanks will have the strongest conquerors and the strongest observation aswell with likes 1 with user_id @deathitself6985 and published  1 year ago"

"comment is devil fruits are the manifestation of dreams, right? Maybe the reason why people die, when they eat a second fruit, is because one body cant contain and/or sustain more than one Dream. Isnt it possible that Blackbeards fruit is basicly representing the antithesis to dreaming/having dreams. That is also the reason why the power of the Devil fruit is darkness: It represents a  state of Not dreaming or activly destroying dreams. For Exempel nihilism, a sleep without a dream, Death or maybe selfdestructing and extrem hedonism. Darkness represents this concept, therefore the darkness can negate other Devil fruit powers and blackbeard doesnt die, when eating another fruit because bis yami-fruit destroys the dream inside of the second fruit. That would also make blackbeard himself to the polar opposite to Luffy, because Luffys fruit is able to wish his and other dreams into Reality.

"comment is Ohara sensei! What if the one piece is an energy source like the sun? Think similar to Spiderman 2. It makes some sense now with egghead island and Dr Vegapunk claims that he needs an unlimited source of energy. He also exclaims that the giant robot ran on similar energy. Joyboy couldve been deemed sun god due to having this source of power. Raftel could be the place where it is located and only joyboy is able to utilize it, or rather a user of the hito hito no mi: model nika. Luffy already grabbed lightnight from the sky, why not be able to grab a small sun? This is why the ancient kingdom couldve been so advanced. If you really want to go down the rabbit hole, this could be why in an old cover story there were robots in space with the pirate flag shaped like Vegapunks head. He couldve been searching for an actual piece of the sun, because joyboy obtained the one piece by taking a piece of the sun, hence giving him the title of “sun god.” The one piece world even has multiple moons, potentially it has multiple suns? with likes 1 with user_id @heathbetty5909 and published  1 year ago"

With that going for him and two of the strongest devil fruits, I don't see him loosing to anyone, he is the dirtiest fighters and one of the smartest in all of one piece with the ability to see the future he wants and never takes a wrong turn and challenge anyone he can't beat with likes 0 with user_id @Impossibly-Possible and published  11 months ago"

"comment is What if the advanced kingdom wanted to help everyone out and passed down their knowledge of tech and devilfruits. Maybe their philosphy was prosperity for all, eventually the 20 kingdoms got greedy and wanted more so they betrayed that advanced kingdom and won. There after one kingdom (imu) got the idea of ruling all and betrayed all 20 kingdoms which is why every major kingdom has some catastrophic event plaguing them...alabasta by drought ...choppers home town by blizzard...water 7 by submersion ...the few that survived needed a way such as wano survived the betrayal by managing to live above ground maybe (terra) there was a devil fruit that allowed them to transform their kingdom....fishmen were the only ones capable of surviving but they needed sunlight so the celestials removed their sun and enslaved them and made it so there is only one location for them to live which is beneath them a place they can monitor all times. Thats why there are ancient weapons hidden underground kingdoms because everything got buried when that kingdom betrayed all 20 but they(WG) kept the technology to themselves ..what if the prison that reaches underwater wasnt even an underwater prison to begin with...the ones that froze choppers lingdom got locked up there and forever froze that floor. The one that brought drought locked there and forever made that one floor dry etc...every kingdom is shrouded by catastrophe or a means to escape that such as zunisha, wano, sky piea. 
Why does Blackbeard never sleep because he was built like a zeraph so he works under the WG or under IMU i bet not even IMU knows where the one piece is at...every one is searching for the one piece except tur WG but them searching for it acknowledges its presence so they make a pirate faction under blackbeard a zeraph and thats how blacbeards member went to WG and told them who to make warlord because they work under IMU and they wouldnt be targetted by higher ups who know true identity of WG. That said not all marines are aware of this since IMU is aware of traitors amongst marines such as Garp etc.. with likes 0 with user_id @juliosantiago7182 and published  1 year ago"

But Imu must betray him and start to make World Government with the 20 countries but some how Princess of Alabasta Nefteri D Lily disagree and she must one support Joy boy with his dream . But those 19 country and Imu they must be the reason behind the death behind Joy boy and Nefteri D lily. In the battle between them the Minks real island may be destroyed then Joy boy must said Zunesha to carry the as his last wish . That will be the reason Zunesha carrying Zou in his back . Also when Rayleigh asked his dream of Luffy he replied that he want to make everyone Joy he knows that Joy boy will return after 800yrs to fullfil his dream. Like Joy boy promised to Fisherman people Luffy also the same promise to them . Roger know that when he reached Laugh tale 20 yrs later Joy boy will come may be that is the reason he said that "" Joy boy i wish i live the same time as you "" he want to see the Joy boy return and want to make the world like he dreamed with likes 0 with user_id @ABHI82769e and published  10 months ago"

"comment is Here’s my theory, Rocks was the last Nika user. First there was joy boy. He had crazy haki and the fruit. Reincarnation comes around and you get roger who has the haki and right will but no fruit, and rocks who had haki, and the fruit but an evil will. So it took to from the D clan to defeat rocks, and boom they got his fruit, covered it up, and roger stole it and hid it. Shanks found it on laugh tale, but didn’t take it because it’s the one piece and he has respect for roger. Luffy ate it though and they’ll fight on laughtale for it then become friends when Blackbeard comes for it since it’s the treasure and he can hold many fruits. Shanks is the new WB, zoro ryuma, luffy joy boy.

Kaido might have never even fought against him and just imagined him being incredibly powerful. To follow that up, shanks and bb aren't his sons, but buggy is.

"comment is If Blackbeard is Rocks clone he wouldn't just be his clone. Every clone we have seen has only been partly a clone of one person. The seraphim are the warlords plus lunarian dna. If we consider the pacifistas clones of kuma then they are clones of kuma plus machinery. ""Well what about Stussy?"" I wonder if Stussy might not even have a devil fruit. We haven't seen it confirmed she does yet. So I wonder if the wing and fang bit might just be Bakkin plus a ""Demon race"" person like Magellan. And there is that theory of Weevil being a buncha rocks pirates mixed with Whitebeard's. 

If This is true then its possible Blackbeard is made up of three people. This would explain the three heads. Its not that Blackbeard is three people but that he is made of three people. This might also explain why Blackbeard can have three devil fruits. Essentially each ""person"" in him has one devil fruit. Here's a crazier thought. What if the three people Blackbeard is made up of are Whitebeard, Rocks, and Wang Ji. I mean it would strengthen them both having names related to the real Blackbeard. Each of them having devil fruits he obtains. After all its stated the Nika fruit somehow chose Luffy. Maybe the devil fruits work on a subconscious level. So much like how Luffy and Zoro referred to Blackbeard as THEM maybe the devil fruits see Blackbeard as Whitebeard and those other guys. So when the devil fruit went out to go reincarnate it saw Whitebeard's ""spirit"" and went back in there. with likes 0 with user_id @darkironyoshi and published  1 year ago (edited)"

comment is Actually I think In the anime (I’m not sure about the manga). When garp is about to start throwing canon balls at luffy as he leaves water 7 garp says ‘you’re the son of my son’ with likes 0 with user_id @felixowen2693 and published  1 year ago

"comment is Video Title: What if Dragon had a Devil fruit?
Video Content: All the main characters discussed one by one.
Result: Dragon is not the main topic of the video.

Impact to viewers: Thats why Ohara is one of the stupid one piece theorist who will not be recognized compare to Tekking which all of his videos make sense. Click bait video thats all with likes 0 with user_id @beeframebox4859 and published  1 year ago"

"comment is But you forgot about the most mysterious character of all, ""Mihawk."" 

Fine, I'll tell you guys about him. First of all, he is stronger than Shanks.
Observation Haki killer!? He is so bad at Observation Haki, so he decided to call himself that to scare people so they don't use it against him. He couldn't even defend himself from a sea eel. He couldn't anticipate Luffy eating the most important devil fruit on the planet. He is so bad that even Blackbeard left his mark on him before going after Ace. He is also friends with Buggy. Mihawk is the only guy who can travel through the grand line without a crew. The guy doesn't even need a navigator or a fridge. He probably doesn't even need to eat to survive. He was even testing Whitebeard to see if he's on his level. Shanks used to mop the floor on our ship. Okay, just kidding... with likes 0 with user_id @Cola-42 and published  1 year ago"
