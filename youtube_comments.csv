"comment is 'I thought it was going to be kobe vs aokiji because garps students and avenging garp and then akainu vs dragon, cuz akainu hates dragon (going dragons son every 5 mins at marineford) and the fact that since theyre the same age, they were prolly in the marines together and likely knew eachother.' with likes= 6 with user_id '@internetguy08' and published(time) '8 hours ago'"

"comment is 'My thoughts & opinions on the chapter (so far):

1. When reading about Vegapunk mentioning the One Piece, as well as Luffy's fellow Emperors reacting to it, wouldn't this lead to the battle royal that Oda once mentioned some time ago?

2. Assuming more Holy Knights are bound to appear in the chapters to come, especially after the Egghead Arc is behind us, then wouldn't this be a perfect opportunity for Dragon & the RA to make their move since drawing them out was partially the reason they attacked Marie Geoise in the 1st place?!' with likes= 21 with user_id '@dfile7598' and published(time) '8 hours ago'"
"comment is 'My theory for the endgame battles would be
Koby vs Blackbeard, because the two have already made a connection with each as Koby ‚Äúhelped‚Äù Blackbeard in the rocky port incident and they met once again at Amazon lily and then Koby got captured and made prisoner on Blackbeard‚Äôs island.

But anyway so, the real life Blackbeard was killed by a navy soldier during his final battle and since the one piece Blackbeard is completely based on the real life Blackbeard I see no better person to defeat Blackbeard other than luffy or koby' with likes= 1 with user_id '@Dragon-is8vb' and published(time) '58 minutes ago'"

"comment is 'My speculated match ups are as follows :

1. Shanks vs BB (inevitable match up and I think Shanks is gonna die and we'll see the true colors of BB )

2. Luffy vs Buggy ( I think this will take place and laughtale and Zoro will also defeat Mihawk at Laughtale and become WSS with luffy becoming the King of the Pirates )

3. Sabo vs Akainu ( As much as I hate to say it because Akainu is my fav character in the whole series, there is a high possibility of this happening )

4. Dragon vs Imu 

5. Koby vs Kuzan

The man with the silhouette is maybe the Holy knight cause he is the same guy which stood in the middle when Dragon talked about holy knights and he is left handed with same sword . So, I doubt he will fight garling' with likes= 0 with user_id '@m.abdullahali1852' and published(time) '2 hours ago'"

"comment is 'Give Buggy a devil fruit awakening. Him and Luffy have always been parallel's to each other, so maybe his fruit awakening is something similar to give 5 in which it's something related to a god that would be kinda awesome (not too sure what god it could be, if there even is one). Maybe it's like how Luffy can turn everything into rubber, Buggy chops everything up or something along those lines.' with likes= 0 with user_id '@ashgrenwinja6439' and published(time) '7 hours ago'"
